How's everybody doing?  
yes, yes.  
Thank you, Thank you!  
Thank you guys very much for coming out.  
what'up y'all beautiful people?  
this is great. man.  
you guts can have a seat now.  
you guts can have a seat.  
thank you, thank you so much!  
where my Asian people at, Asian people?  
Hey! you came out!  
we are here representing, man.  
I got to say, it's been a couple of good years for us Asians. right?  
We had "Crazy Rich Asians" last year.  
That was a huge moment for us, yeah.  
Jeremy Lin won a championship... for doing nothing.  
he is the first Asian kid to receive a participation trophy.    

> participation 参与  

We got to be proud of him, finally.  
It's great couple of years, man.  
But this is recent histroy.  
i don't know if you guys remenber this.  
Just three years ago, there was a movie, called "The Great Wall"  
starring Matt Damon, It was a real movie.    

> starring adj. 最重要的演员的  v. 扮演主角，领衔主演；用星状花纹装饰；给……加上星号（star 的现在分词）  

It was Matt Damon in ancient China, fighting dragons and shit, and everybody spoke English?  
I said, what the  fuck is this?  
But you got to understand, I'am not mad at Matt Damon, OK?  
He's an actor, That's what he does for a living.  
That's how he gets a check. I get it.  
If somebody were to offer me a lead role in a movie called "Mount Rushmore"...   
I would play the shit out of George Washington.  

> Mount Rushmore 拉什莫尔山; 总统山  
> 此处Jimmy调侃"长城"选美国人Matt做主演   

You know what I mean?  
No shame in my game.  

> No shame in my game 的意思是说, Matt能在"长城"里做主演, 那么Jimmy演美国总统也没什么丢脸的  
> You have nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed of  

I'll play George Washinton Carver if they let me.  

> George Washington Carver (1860s – January 5, 1943) was an American agricultural scientist, and he is a black man  

That's black guy, by the way, I don't know if you know.  
Gotta represent, man.  
I see a lot of people out there in the streets.  
they want to come up to me, but they're not really sure.  
There's a lot of debate amongst their friends.  
They're like, hey man, are you sure that's him?  
If we go up there, we got to be sure.  
Because if we go up there and it's not him,  
we're gonna look super racist.  
Are you sure that's not Ken Jeong?  
I don't know, it looks like Ali Wong.  
And they come up to me. it's always like, the first thing.  
they say, like, hey hey man, aren't you that dude Jian Yang from that show "Silicon Valley"?  
And I'm like, oh, thanks.  
Oh yeah yeah yeah, thank you.  
thank you, I appreciate that, Yeah, I am.  
And they are like, oh, shit, I didn't even know you speak english in real life!  
I'm like, It's called acting, motherfucker.  
Like, did you really think Matt Damon was Chinese?  
Like, what's wrong with you?  
I don't know what the disconnect is.  
Like, if a white actor does a British accent.  
he's a thespian.  

> thespian adj. 戏剧的；悲剧性的；泰斯庇斯的   

he wins an Oscar.  
If I do a Chinese accent, I'm automatically from the old country.  
Representation matters man.  
A lot of Asian people come up to me, very proud, very nice.  
They're like, Jimmy, thank you for represent the Asian, man.  
I'm like, eh, you're welcome.  
But you do understand, It's not really a choice, right?  
Like, when you wake up Asian, you can only represent Asians.  
I couldn't just wake up one day and be like, fuck it, I'm representing Nigerians today.  
I'm very proud to represent Asians.  
But the same time, there's so much pressure.  
Like, nobudy ever went to Matt Damon and be like, hey, Matt, thanks for representing the whites.  
It sounds weird.  
That's like a different conversation for some reason, you know?   
If somebody come to me being like, hey, Jimmy, I'm represent for the whites.  
I would leave that town immediately.  
and never come back.  

> represent for the whites, 这一段是啥意思? 白人至上主义?  

So much pressure to represent.  
I got to be a good Asian everywhere now.  
I got to tip everywhere I go.  
That was one of the major adventages of being Asians is I could just pretend I don't know how to tip.  
Y'all know what a Chinese tip is?  
Chinese tip, it doesn't matter how big you bill is, you tip $2, That's a Chi--  
That's a Chinese tip man.  
Now I got to tip 20% everywhere.  
I got to give every Uber driver five-star ratings.  
just so I can be a good representative.  
Everywhere I go, I got to represent.  
Even day to day shit, even the bedroom I got to represent.  
After I hooked up with this one girl, 
that is what she said to me, She was like, Jimmy,   
I don;t know how to tell you this.  
but you're the first Asian guy I've ever been with.  
I'm like Ok,  
What do you want, a fortune cookie? Like wha-?   

> fortune cookie 在美国，每顿中餐的尾声都是幸运饼干   
> 美国人民对于幸运饼干的依赖，超乎我们的想象。在全世界，每年都有30亿个幸运饼干被吃掉，其中绝大多数来自美国。最大的幸运饼干制造商是总部位于纽约布鲁克林的Wonton Food Inc.（云吞食品公司），他们每天生产超过450万个幸运饼干。  

Like what do you want?  
She acted like she just unlocked a new character on Street Fighter or some shit.  
Why do you feel the need to say that?  
I love old Asian people, man.  
Yeah, yeah, old Asian people are the best.  
But why are all old Asian people always stretching in the park?  
Like, it doesn't matter which city you're in,  
which park you go to, you wake up 6:30 in the morning,  
you see about 250 old Asian people, all doing this shit at the same time,  
for like three hours,  
What the fuck are they doing?  
And my dad was trying to explain to me.  
He's like, oh they're warming up to do Tai Chi.  
I'm like, for how long?  
And ironically, Tai Chi is a warm-up in itself.  
So they warming up to warm up for nothing.  
And I think a lot of Americans, like people think that Tai Chi to some, like exotic Chinese secret. Some oriental art.  

> exotic adj. 异国的；外来的；异国情调的  

No Tai Chi is just exercise for people who are too old to exercise.  
Let's not exoticize these things, you know?  
It's actually super simple to do Tai Chi.  
I went to a park, watched those old people for like an hour,  
and I learned how to do Tai Chi.  
Very simple, all you gotta do is two things.  
All you gotta do to do Tai Chi is pretend you're wiping down a window,  
and getting a blow job at the same time.  
You guts seenm skeptical,  

> skeptical adj. 怀疑的   

Allow me to demonstrate.  
It's very simple.  
All you gotta do, you get it your little stance, right, OK?  

> stance n. 立场；姿态；位置；准备击球姿势  

And then you wipe down a window.  
And now you get a blow job.  
Then you lift her head up, because you're a gentleman, you know?  
That's Tai Chi.  
Thank you, thank you.  
Let's not exoticize these Asian things.  
They're just old people reminiscing about the days when they got sucked off, that's it.  

>> reminiscing v. 追忆

You got to take advantages of all these, like Asian stereotypes, you know?  
If people are just going to exoticize us, that's fine.  
Whenever somebody asks me to do something I don't want to do,  
I just make up a fake Chinese holiday now.  
It's like, hey Jimmy can you help me move next Monday?  
I'm like Monday?  
That's the Dragon Boat Lychee Boba Festiva, dog.  
I can't, I can't just help you move.  
My grandfather died for that shit, you understand?  
And if people are just gonna assume that I don't speak English, that's fine.  
That's what I do now when I get pulled over by the cops.  
I just pretend I don't speak English.  
I haven't gotten a ticket in five years.  
Last time I got pulled over.  
the cop was knocking on my window.  
He was like, sir, you do understand you can't make a right turn here?  
It says right there on the sign.  
You can't make a right turn.  
So I just looked up at him, I was like, Oh, I don't know.  
I'm sorry, but my English not very good.  
So I can not read the sign.  
And he was really confused. He just looked back down at me.  
He was like, sir, the sign is not in English.  
It's a diagram, so I don't understand how that's a language barrier?  
So I just looked up at him, I was like, Oh, I don't know.  
But do you know today is the Dragon Boat Lychee Boba...
