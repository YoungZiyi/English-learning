How's everybody doing?  
yes, yes.  
Thank you, Thank you!  
Thank you guys very much for coming out.  
what'up y'all beautiful people?  
this is great. man.  
you guts can have a seat now.  
you guts can have a seat.  
thank you, thank you so much!  
where my Asian people at, Asian people?  
Hey! you came out!  
we are here representing, man.  
I got to say, it's been a couple of good years for us Asians. right?  
We had "Crazy Rich Asians" last year.  
That was a huge moment for us, yeah.  
Jeremy Lin won a championship... for doing nothing.  
he is the first Asian kid to receive a participation trophy.    

> participation 参与  

We got to be proud of him, finally.  
It's great couple of years, man.  
But this is recent histroy.  
i don't know if you guys remenber this.  
Just three years ago, there was a movie, called "The Great Wall"  
starring Matt Damon, It was a real movie.    

> starring adj. 最重要的演员的  v. 扮演主角，领衔主演；用星状花纹装饰；给……加上星号（star 的现在分词）  

It was Matt Damon in ancient China, fighting dragons and shit, and everybody spoke English?  
I said, what the  fuck is this?  
But you got to understand, I'am not mad at Matt Damon, OK?  
He's an actor, That's what he does for a living.  
That's how he gets a check. I get it.  
If somebody were to offer me a lead role in a movie called "Mount Rushmore"...   
I would play the shit out of George Washington.  

> Mount Rushmore 拉什莫尔山; 总统山  
> 此处Jimmy调侃"长城"选美国人Matt做主演   

You know what I mean?  
No shame in my game.  

> No shame in my game 的意思是说, Matt能在"长城"里做主演, 那么Jimmy演美国总统也没什么丢脸的  
> You have nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed of  

I'll play George Washinton Carver if they let me.  

> George Washington Carver (1860s – January 5, 1943) was an American agricultural scientist, and he is a black man  

That's black guy, by the way, I don't know if you know.  
Gotta represent, man.  
I see a lot of people out there in the streets.  
they want to come up to me, but they're not really sure.  
There's a lot of debate amongst their friends.  
They're like, hey man, are you sure that's him?  
If we go up there, we got to be sure.  
Because if we go up there and it's not him,  
we're gonna look super racist.  
Are you sure that's not Ken Jeong?  
I don't know, it looks like Ali Wong.  
And they come up to me. it's always like, the first thing.  
they say, like, hey hey man, aren't you that dude Jian Yang from that show "Silicon Valley"?  
And I'm like, oh, thanks.  
Oh yeah yeah yeah, thank you.  
thank you, I appreciate that, Yeah, I am.  
And they are like, oh, shit, I didn't even know you speak english in real life!  
I'm like, It's called acting, motherfucker.  
Like, did you really think Matt Damon was Chinese?  
Like, what's wrong with you?  
I don't know what the disconnect is.  
Like, if a white actor does a British accent.  
he's a thespian.  

> thespian adj. 戏剧的；悲剧性的；泰斯庇斯的   

he wins an Oscar.  
If I do a Chinese accent, I'm automatically from the old country.  
Representation matters man.  
A lot of Asian people come up to me, very proud, very nice.  
They're like, Jimmy, thank you for represent the Asians, man.  
I'm like, eh, you're welcome.  
But you do understand, It's not really a choice, right?  
Like, when you wake up Asian, you can only represent Asians.  
I couldn't just wake up one day and be like, fuck it, I'm representing Nigerians today.  
I'm very proud to represent Asians.  
But the same time, there's so much pressure.  
Like, nobudy ever went to Matt Damon and be like, hey, Matt, thanks for representing the whites.  
It sounds weird.  
That's like a different conversation for some reason, you know?   
If somebody come to me being like, hey, Jimmy, I'm represent for the whites.  
I would leave that town immediately.  
and never come back.  

> represent for the whites, 这一段是啥意思? 白人至上主义?  

So much pressure to represent.  
I got to be a good Asian everywhere now.  
I got to tip everywhere I go.  
That was one of the major adventages of being Asians is I could just pretend I don't know how to tip.  
Y'all know what a Chinese tip is?  
Chinese tip, it doesn't matter how big you bill is, you tip $2, That's a Chi--  
That's a Chinese tip man.  
Now I got to tip 20% everywhere.  
I got to give every Uber driver five-star ratings.  
just so I can be a good representative.  
Everywhere I go, I got to represent.  
Even day to day shit, even the bedroom I got to represent.  
After I hooked up with this one girl, 
that is what she said to me, She was like, Jimmy,   
I don;t know how to tell you this.  
but you're the first Asian guy I've ever been with.  
I'm like Ok,  
What do you want, a fortune cookie? Like wha-?   

> fortune cookie 在美国，每顿中餐的尾声都是幸运饼干   
> 美国人民对于幸运饼干的依赖，超乎我们的想象。在全世界，每年都有30亿个幸运饼干被吃掉，其中绝大多数来自美国。最大的幸运饼干制造商是总部位于纽约布鲁克林的Wonton Food Inc.（云吞食品公司），他们每天生产超过450万个幸运饼干。  

Like what do you want?  
She acted like she just unlocked a new character on Street Fighter or some shit.  
Why do you feel the need to say that?  
I love old Asian people, man.  
Yeah, yeah, old Asian people are the best.  
But why are all old Asian people always stretching in the park?  
Like, it doesn't matter which city you're in,  
which park you go to, you wake up 6:30 in the morning,  
you see about 250 old Asian people, all doing this shit at the same time,  
for like three hours,  
What the fuck are they doing?  
And my dad was trying to explain to me.  
He's like, oh they're warming up to do Tai Chi.  
I'm like, for how long?  
And ironically, Tai Chi is a warm-up in itself.  
So they warming up to warm up for nothing.  
And I think a lot of Americans, like people think that Tai Chi to some, like exotic Chinese secret. Some oriental art.  

> exotic adj. 异国的；外来的；异国情调的  

No Tai Chi is just exercise for people who are too old to exercise.  
Let's not exoticize these things, you know?  
It's actually super simple to do Tai Chi.  
I went to a park, watched those old people for like an hour,  
and I learned how to do Tai Chi.  
Very simple, all you gotta do is two things.  
All you gotta do to do Tai Chi is pretend you're wiping down a window,  
and getting a blow job at the same time.  
You guts seenm skeptical,  

> skeptical adj. 怀疑的   

Allow me to demonstrate.  
It's very simple.  
All you gotta do, you get it your little stance, right, OK?  

> stance n. 立场；姿态；位置；准备击球姿势  

And then you wipe down a window.  
And now you get a blow job.  
Then you lift her head up, because you're a gentleman, you know?  
That's Tai Chi.  
Thank you, thank you.  
Let's not exoticize these Asian things.  
They're just old people reminiscing about the days when they got sucked off, that's it.  

> reminiscing v. 追忆

You got to take advantages of all these, like Asian stereotypes, you know?  
If people are just going to exoticize us, that's fine.  
Whenever somebody asks me to do something I don't want to do,  
I just make up a fake Chinese holiday now.  
It's like, hey Jimmy can you help me move next Monday?  
I'm like Monday?  
That's the Dragon Boat Lychee Boba Festiva, dog.  
I can't, I can't just help you move.  
My grandfather died for that shit, you understand?  
And if people are just gonna assume that I don't speak English, that's fine.  
That's what I do now when I get pulled over by the cops.  
I just pretend I don't speak English.  
I haven't gotten a ticket in five years.  
Last time I got pulled over.  
the cop was knocking on my window.  
He was like, sir, you do understand you can't make a right turn here?  
It says right there on the sign.  
You can't make a right turn.  
So I just looked up at him, I was like, Oh, I don't know.  
I'm sorry, but my English not very good.  
So I can not read the sign.  
And he was really confused. He just looked back down at me.  
He was like, sir, the sign is not in English.  
It's a diagram, so I don't understand how that's a language barrier?  
So I just looked up at him, I was like, Oh, I don't know.  
But do you know today is the Dragon Boat Lychee Boba...  
You got to use it to your advantage people.  
I'm very happy to be here, man.  
Thank you, Oh, you guys don't have to, thank you.  
Thank you for all your support.  
It's been great, it's been really great.  
Like, I'm finally... I'm like quasi-famous now.  
Nothing really changed.  
I might get a free appetizer at select PF Chang's.  
That's about it. Nothing really changed.  
I was still using Tinder up until like a year ago.  
This is true story.  
But now I realize I got a whole new set of issue on Tinder.  
Like now, when I match with a girl,  
she doesn't believe that it's me.  
Like ew, that's not you.  
You're not that guy from this thing and that thing.  
I'm like, who the fuck is using me as a fake profile?  
You gotta dig real deep to use me. man.  
I feel like there's so many better choices out there.  
One time, one time, my agent told me that I have a good look.  
And I'm like, thanks, dude, I appreciate that.  
But then it took me years to realuze that having a good look is totallu different than being good-looking.  
I still don't know what the fuck it means.  
And look, I'm not being self-deprecating, Ok?  

> self-deprecating adj. 自贬的；谦虚的（等于 self-deprecatory）  

That's Hollywood talk, I don't listen to that shit.  
I understand that, in real life, I'm super good-looking...  
if you into anime.  
You gotta get in where you fit in, people.   
One time, I went over to the girl's house,  
she has this, like, Naruto anime poster in her bedroom.  
I knew I was fucking that night.  
You got to know your demo people.  
Asian people, we don't need Tinder anymore.  
We just go to BTS concerts.  
That't how we do that parking for pimping.  
I've been dating a lot of tall girls lately,  
because it makes me look successful.  
No, no, I think tall women are beautiful.  
But some of them like to wear heels.  
That's just disrespect.  
Like, you're already 5 inches taller than me.  
Wht the fuck you wearing heels?  
She's like, it makes my ass look better.  
I'm like, your ass is at my eye level right now.  
Neither of us look good, OK?  
I look like a child, and you look like a child molester.  
Last time, the last time I took a tall girl to this concert.  
I don't know if you guys know this,  
but apparently, tall people have fun at concerts.  
Are you guys aware of that?  
I'm 5'5, I just go to concerts to smell other people's armpits.  
I'm like, what the fuck is th point of this?  
She was having the time of her life.  
doing whatever tall people do at the concerts, you know.  
jumping around, obstructing other people's views, seeing everything.  
I was frustrated, I had enough.  
So I just looked up at her, I was like,  
hey! pick me up. this is bullshit, I paid for these tickets, Ok?  
I want to see Billy Eilish, too. come on.  
I know I'm became an adult finally,  
because now my favorite TV show is "Fixer Upper" on HGTV.  
That's the greatest show of all time.  
You guys watch it, Chip and Joanna Gaines, "Fixer Upper"?  
It's a great show, right? It's a great show.  
Like, it's really a beautiful relationship.  
Joanna does all the interior decorating,  
and she brings all the furniture and makes the house look amazing.  
And Chip just hires Mexicans to do everything for him.  
It's the most symbiotic American relationship ever.  
And, it's a really nice show.  
It's a feel good show.  
It's an inspiring show.  
You watch the show and you're like, man, one day, maybe my house could look that nice.  
if I moved to Waco, Texas.  
If I just give up all my life and move to Waco, Texas,  
maybe I can have a new open concept kitchen.  
I don't know about you guys.  
Shit is expensive where I live in LA.  
And I watch this show and I just get frustrated.  
Because you get, like, these like,  
entry-level-job having people in Texas.  

> entry-level-job 入门级别的工作  

And they're like, Joanna, We're looking for a six bedroom house on three acres of land and out budget's $50.000.  
Bitch, I can't even buy a crack house in Compton for $50.000.  
HGTV is just basically "MTV Cribs" for adults.  
Because when you were 15, you had vrazier dreams, you know?  
You watch "MTV Cribs"  and you're like,  
oh, man, one day, I hope I can have a Lamborghini.  
One day, I hope I can have a fridge with only Gatorades.  
And now, you're like 35, your dream just get a little more realistic.  
You're watching HGTV, and you're just, like, oh, man, one day, I wish I could just fix this roof.  
Look, I'm doing, like, fine by any measure, you know?  
But I still live in a one-bedroom apartment because that shit is rent-controlled.  

> rent-controlled 租金管制??? 啥意思?  

And when the Asian people, when we find a good deal,  
we're never letting that shit go. yeah.  
That apartment is about to be generational.  
It's gonna get passed to my nephew, his kids, and all that.  
It's mine now, basically.  
I don't want to buy a house. I live by myself,  
and I'm scared of ghosts.  
I've seen enough movies to know that ghosts only haunt houses.  
not one bedroom apartments.  
I've seen enough Hollywood movies to know that ghost only haunt rich people's houses.  
in the suburbs, preferably with a newborn baby, because they got way too much to lose.  
Shit is high stakes.  
I live by myself. I ain't got nothing to lose.  
A ghost come haunt me, I just move.  
Worse comes to worse. I lose my securith deposit.  
Fuck it, you know?  
What's a ghost gonna do?  
He's gonna follow me from unit to unit.  
start knocking on my light fixtures, and shit.  

> light fixtures 灯固定架???  

I'm like, hey, dog, go ahead. It's not even mine.  
You fuck around, we both get evicted, OK?  
Like, you don't wanna be a homeless ghost.  
And if you really think about it, what kind of loser ghost haunts an apartment?  
That means that ghost probably died in an apartment.  
He didn't even die a homeowner.  
I ain't got no respect for that shit.  
He comes haunt me, I just start talking shit to him.  
Like, hey, dog, what was your credit score when you died, though, like, for real?  
00:16:55
