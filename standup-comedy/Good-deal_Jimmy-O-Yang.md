you guts can have a seat.

where my Asian people at, Asian people?  
Hey! you came out!  
we are here representing, man.  
I got to say, it's been a couple of good years for us Asians. right?  
We had "Crazy Rich Asians" last year.  
That was a huge moment for us, yeah.  
Jeremy Lin won a championship... for doing nothing.  
he is the first Asian kid to receive a participation trophy.    

> participation 参与  

We got to be proud of him, finally.  
It's great couple of years, man.  
But this is recent histroy.  
i don't know if you guys remenber this.  
Just three years ago, there was a movie, called "The Great Wall"  
starring Matt Damon, It was a real movie.    

> adj. 最重要的演员的  v. 扮演主角，领衔主演；用星状花纹装饰；给……加上星号（star 的现在分词）  

It was Matt Damon in ancient China, fighting dragons and shit, and everybody spoke English?  
I said, what the  fuck is this?  
But you got to understand, I'am not mad at Matt Damon, OK?  
He's an actor, That's what he does for a living.  
That's how he gets a check. I get it.  
If somebody were to offer me a lead role in a movie called "Mount Rushmore"...   
I would play the shit out of George Washington.  

> Mount Rushmore 拉什莫尔山; 总统山  
> 此处Jimmy调侃"长城"选美国人Matt做主演   

You know what I mean?  
No shame in my game.  

> No shame in my game的意思是说, Matt能在"长城"里做主演, 那么Jimmy演美国总统也没什么丢脸的  
> You have nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed of  

I'll play George Washinton Carver if they let me.  

> George Washington Carver (1860s – January 5, 1943) was an American agricultural scientist, and he is a black man  

That's black guy, by the way, I don't know if you know.  
Gotta represent, man.  
I see a lot of people out there in the streets.  
they want to come up to me, but they're not really sure.  
There's a lot of debate amongst their friends.  
They're like, hey man, are you sure that's him?  
If we go up there, we got to be sure.  
Because if we go up there and it's not him,  
we're gonna look super racist.  
Are you sure that's not Ken Jeong?  
I don't know, it looks like Ali Wong.
